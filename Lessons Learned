Things we learned over the course of this project:

-Even if you think you're close to being done, still try and finish early because debugging takes forever.
-Make sure everyone is on the same page at the end of a group meeting.
-Make sure everyone has their voice heard in order to make the best possible product.
-Start as soon as the project is assigned.
-You'll be a lot more productive if you work in a productive academic atmosphere as opposed to at home.
-Make sure everyone understands every part of the project or else finishing it will be very difficult.
